						<p>I may not have the most knowledge on this subject, but here is my revised version of the pie chart for the Candidacy Consideration Weighting. Below, I have the importance of each section of the pie chart and why it is allotted the slot it is.</p>
						<h3 style="background-color:pink; color:black;line-height: 200%;text-indent:40px;">Teaching</h3>
						<p>The main role of professors is to educate students, many people believe this should take up  their entire focus. But this just covers the direct teaching the professor should focus on to have the one on one to educate the students.</p>
						<h3 style="background-color:lightblue; color:black;line-height: 200%;text-indent:40px;">Research</h3>
						<p>This highly benefits the institution where the professor teaches, but also motivates students by proving that their educators have extreme practical knowledge. This not only helps the university's success but also encourages students to pursue research themselves.</p>
						<h3 style="background-color:orange; color:black;line-height: 200%;text-indent:40px;">Service</h3>
						<p>A small part of a professor's time should be to enhance the quality of the school to keep a quality future for the institution, with the aim of maintaining the highest standard of education from the university.</p>
						<h3 style="background-color:#98FF98; color:black;line-height: 200%;text-indent:40px;">Diversity</h3>
						<p>I'm not entirely sure of its use in this context, but diversity is crucial as it exposes students to a wide range of perspectives and learning styles, enriching their educational experience.</p>
						<h3 style="background-color:#00FFFF; color:black;line-height: 200%;text-indent:40px;">Professional Development</h3>
						<p>I believe teaching should not only benefit the students but also help professors in their personal and professional development. It should build the quality of their teaching and equip them with skills they can use in various ways in the future, rather teaching or researching.</p>
						<h3 style="background-color:black; color:white;line-height: 200%;text-indent:40px;">About the Authors</h3>
						<p>I am writing from my viewpoint as a second-year student double majoring in Data Science and Computer Science, this is my attempt at evenly distributing the elements of this pie chart based on my current understanding.</p>
