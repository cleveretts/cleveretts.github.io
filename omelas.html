        <p>
            Ursula K. Le Guin bounces around a direct idea with of Omelas, to make us wonder if being happy is worth it if you must make someone else suffer for it.
        </p>
        <p> 
            This challenges us to think of the cost of our joy at the expense of another's pain
        </p>
        <p>
            The story has us consider the true value of happiness with a hidden cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            This questions the foundation of happiness built on the foundation of suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Le Guin's narrative forces us to consider the <strong>ethics</strong> of a happiness that depends on hidden cruelty
